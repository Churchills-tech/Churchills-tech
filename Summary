Connecting the sensor on the Raspberry Pi motherboard ports

Red cable connects to port 1 (3v3 power)

Brown cable connects to port 3 (GPI02 SDA)

After the cables connected properly and the right commands sent to Raspberry Pi through Putty

The sensor generates data which is recorded into IoT Core.

*********Major takeaways***************

If the sensor cables are not fixed appropriately to the designated port number on the Raspberry Pi motherboard, data cannot be generated. 

Lastly, if the public key and the primary key are not generated using the appropriate method, 

The Raspberry Pi device will not be able to communicate with the IoT Core successfully.
